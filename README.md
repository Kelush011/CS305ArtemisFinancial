# CS305ArtemisFinancial
1. Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
   
     For this assignment I was a developer working with the client Artemis Financial. Artemis Financial is a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for their customers. These financial plns include savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. The client wants to modernize their software and use the most current and effective software security. They want our expertise on how to protect the organization from external threats. As the developer I needed to examine their software to identify any security vulnerabilities and then document my findings as well as come up with a mitigation plan for the software. 
   
2. What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

     One thing that I think I did very well was identifying the security risks in detail. I provided a very detailed list of all of the vulnerabilities as well as listed which versions were affected by those vulnerabilities. It is vital that as developers we code securely especially when dealing with personal data for customers. We want to make sure that our code is secure to prevent any data leaks from occuring as well as to protect the customers. In doing so we can ensure that the customers information such as their date of birth, financial information, and etc. remains safe from outside attacks. Software security can provide the company with the confidence that their software is safe and protected from outside threats. This will provide the client with safety as well as ensure that their customers remain protected as well. 
    
3. What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

  The vulnerability assessment was actually very interesting to see. I enjoyed getting the assessment to run and identify all of the vulnerabilites that the program had. It was extremely interesting to see how the vulnerabilities could affect the program and what sort of attacks may occur due to those vulnerabilities. It was extremely useful in idenifying the vulnerabilities as well as understanding how those vulnerabilities could affect the program. It was challenging to get the assessment to run at first but after following my resources closely I was able to get it to run as well as understand it. 

4. How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
  
  We learned how to implement Certificate Authorities which can provide more security for the program involved. It allows the devloper or a third party to create a key that must be applied to tranfer data securely. I think that in the future I would continue to use the dependency check tool to find the vulnerabilities of any java libraries that I am using. It will also provide me with the information on what needs to be updated to the newest version or what needs to be removed and replaced altogether. Knowing this information can help the mitigation to run more smoothly as well as provide me with where I should start first. 
  
5. How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

    To make sure my code was functional and secure I made sure that any warnings or errors were taken care of. By running the dependency check I was able to identify any old vulnerabilities as well as identify any vulnerabilities that may have been introduced when I refactored the code. 
   
6. What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
   
   I think that the OWASP Secure Coding Practices Quick Reference Guide was very helpful in showing me how to plug the dependency check tool into my program. It also helped me to understand how the depency check worked and provided examples using the dependency check tool to test for security issues. This is definitely a tool I would use in the future to make sure my programs are secure. 
   
7. Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

   This assignment would be able to show my future employers that I was able to successfully run an assessment as well as identify the vulnerabilities present within the program. I think this would provide my employers with the reassurance that I know how to check my code for vulnerabilities as well as help them to see that I know how to deal with those vulnerabilities. This would reassure them that I am using secure coding practices and also show that I know how to check for vulnerabilities to ensure that my program is secure.
